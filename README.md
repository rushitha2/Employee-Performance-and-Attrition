## Problem Statement
Organizations face significant challenges in managing employee 
performance and retention. High employee attrition not only leads to increased hiring costs 
but also results in the loss of institutional knowledge, reduced productivity, and potential 
disruptions in business operations. Many organizations struggle to identify the root causes of 
attrition and performance issues due to the lack of comprehensive data analysis. 

## Key concerns include: 
- Inability to accurately assess employee performance trends over time.
- Difficulty in identifying critical factors that contribute to voluntary and involuntary attrition.
- Inefficient HR decision-making due to the absence of deeper insights. 
- Challenges in correlating compensation, job satisfaction, and work-life balance with employee retention. 

## Technology Stack 
- Data Warehouse: Centralized storage of structured data from various sources. 
- SQL: Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes. 
- Python: Data preprocessing, statistical analysis. 
- Power BI: Visualization and reporting.

## Outcomes 
- A clear understanding of factors affecting employee performance and attrition.
- Actionable insights for HR teams to enhance employee retention.
- A user-friendly dashboard for continuous monitoring and decision-making.
